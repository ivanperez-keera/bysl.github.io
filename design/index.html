			<h2> Treehouse </h2>
			<p>
				I currently work with the <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a> <a href="http://dribbble.com/treehouse">design team</a> as a Product Designer. I also code landing pages, illustrate course assets, chip away at our styleguide, and <a href="https://medium.com/treehouse-engineering">write blog posts.</a> Featured above is the <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/back-to-school">Back to School</a> 2015 marketing campaign.

			<h2> Guest Center </h2>
			<p>
				I worked on <a href="http://guestcenter.opentable.com">OpenTable's restaurant products.</a> Experience designers are responsible for design work across platforms: web, mobile web, and iPad. I lead design on the <a href="https://community.otrestaurant.com/t5/Conversations/Floor-Plan-Availability-View-and-Other-New-Guest-Center-Features/td-p/4036"> reservation timeline</a> as well as the beta website.

				I worked with <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blippy-make-your-own-gif-keyboard/id929359042?mt=8">Blippy</a> on their GIF collecting and sharing app. We iterated on the mobile interface and brand. Blippy created one of the first <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/20/blippy-returns-with-a-brand-new-gif-keyboard-for-ios-8/">GIF keyboards for iOS8.</a>

			<h2> Beyond Pricing </h2>
			<p>
				I worked with <a href="http://beyondpricing.com/">Beyond Pricing</a> to create a brand, website, and styleguide. The design components were created to work as a reusable system as new features are built. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/26/best-airbnb-price/">Beyond Pricing recently secured Series A funding.</a>
				<br><br>
				A rave review of the brand: <br>
				"Airdna faces some stiff competition. [...] Beyond Pricing is one such product, and its slick beautiful design puts Airdnaâ€™s early 2000s look to shame."

			<h2> Trulia Styleguide </h2>
			<p>
				I was a founder and maintainer on the core styleguide team. We created a living CSS styleguide to establish and maintain a cohesive design language. The components were reusable in the front-end codebase. We collaborated with <a href="http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2013/06/05/creating-living-style-guides-to-improve-performance/">Nicole Sullivan</a> and her team on the initial groundwork.

				<br><br>

				The styleguide was written in Sass using Object Oriented CSS (OOCSS) methodologies. The team built and open sourced <a href="http://trulia.github.io/hologram/">Hologram</a> a Ruby gem that generates a styleguide from your CSS comments.

				<br><br>

				<a href="/talks">I presented a talk</a> about the styleguide and how design processes evolved based on this work.

			<h2> Trulia </h2>
			<p>
				I lead design on Trulia consumer products. With the styleguide, it became easier to <a href="/images/work/trulia-css.gif">prototype quickly.</a> My contributions included leading design on Search, Home Detail Pages, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/06/trulia-suggest/">data-driven Recommend Homes</a>, Mobile Web, For Rent products, the <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1172093-Trulia-for-Android-Properties-details-page-update">Android app</a>, and <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1002475-trulia-the-house-oocss-built">Lego themed shirts.</a>
				<br><br>
				 After the team refreshed Search using our CSS library: <br>
				 "I like the direction that Trulia is taking its design. Deep-sixing that left rail of refiners is like a blast of fresh air across the page." <br>

			<h2> Side Project: Library </h2>
			<p>
				<a href="http://bysusanlin.com/library">The Librarian</a> is a fully repsonsive site I implemented that helps me keep track of the books I own. It is powered by a Google spreadsheet.

			<h2> Side Project: Daily RSS Feed </h2>
			<p>
				Daily is a fully responsive stream page of RSS feeds I frequented. It was set as my homepage when I started up my browser. The project was designed from <a href="http://instagram.com/p/r35yvby49T/?modal=true">a sketch</a> and then built right in the code. Due to how infrequently my feeds updated, I pulled the plug on Daily.

			<h2> NASA </h2>
			<p>
				Old work that's interesting. I interned and freelanced with NASA's education outreach team who worked on the James Webb Space Telescope. I illustrated art for 2 games <a href="http://jwst.nasa.gov/scope.html">Scope it out!</a> and <a href="http://jwst.nasa.gov/build.html">Build It Yourself: Satellite!</a> I also made print designs which were <a href="http://sketch.bysusanlin.com/tagged/nasa">seen on the set of The Big Bang Theory.</a> It was an experience that set the tone for my entrance into the industry.

			<h2> Indie Games </h2>
			<p>
				Old work that's interesting. During college, I shipped <a href="http://www.gamecreation.org/search/node/susan%20lin">an indie game every semester.</a> The best of the bunch was Raincat &mdash; a 2D puzzle game where you keep the cat dry. <a href="http://raincat.bysusanlin.com">The site</a> I made to promote it has accrued over 16,000 views. It was a project that taught me how to share work online.
