			<h2> Design </h2>
			<p>
				I am a Senior level Product Designer with 7 years of experience and a graduate MHCI degree from CMU. This is a selected history of work.
				<br><br>
				I have designed across platforms and especially feel at home on the web. My core contributions are user flows, experience maps, UI finesse, prototypes, seeing a design to ship, and owning the post-shipping follow-up for the UX. I have created and maintained Design Systems for both small and large teams in collaboration with fellow designers and engineers. I can write production worthy HTML and CSS/Sass as well as illustrate clean visual imagery. My contributions have shown demonstrable returns on investment.
		 		<br><br>
				Additionally, I am an active member of the global creative community. I have spent the past few years traveling far and often to create <a href="/sketchnotes">sketchnotes</a>, give <a href="/talks">talks</a>, and show <a href="/about#art-shows">artwork.</a> I have mentored junior designers and high school students interested in the industry. I have coached fellow designers about design systems and Sass.

			<h2> Beyond Pricing </h2>
			<p>
				I worked with <a href="http://beyondpricing.com/">Beyond Pricing</a> to create a brand, website, and design system. The design components were created to work as a reusable system as new features are built. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/26/best-airbnb-price/">Beyond Pricing recently secured Series A funding.</a>
				<br><br>
				A rave review of the brand: <br>
				"Airdna faces some stiff competition. [...] Beyond Pricing is one such product, and its slick beautiful design puts Airdnaâ€™s early 2000s look to shame."

			<h2> Trulia Design System </h2>
			<p>
				I was a founder and maintainer on the core design systems team. We created a living CSS design system to establish and maintain a cohesive design language. The components were reusable in the front-end codebase. We collaborated with <a href="http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2013/06/05/creating-living-style-guides-to-improve-performance/">Nicole Sullivan</a> and her team on the initial groundwork.

				<br><br>

				The design system was written in Sass using Object Oriented CSS (OOCSS) methodologies. The team built and open sourced <a href="http://trulia.github.io/hologram/">Hologram</a> a Ruby gem that generates a design system from your CSS comments.

				<br><br>

				<a href="/talks">I presented a talk</a> about the design system and how design processes evolved based on this work.

			<h2> Trulia </h2>
			<p>
				I lead design on Trulia consumer products. With the design system, it became easier to <a href="/images/work/trulia-css.gif">prototype quickly.</a> My contributions included leading design on Search, Home Detail Pages, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/06/trulia-suggest/">data-driven Recommend Homes</a>, Mobile Web, For Rent products, the <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1172093-Trulia-for-Android-Properties-details-page-update">Android app</a>, and <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1002475-trulia-the-house-oocss-built">Lego themed shirts.</a>
				<br><br>
				 After the team refreshed Search using our CSS library: <br>
				 "I like the direction that Trulia is taking its design. Deep-sixing that left rail of refiners is like a blast of fresh air across the page." <br>

			<h2> Daily RSS Feed </h2>

				Daily is a fully responsive stream page of RSS feeds I frequented. It was set as my homepage when I started up my browser. The project was designed from <a href="http://instagram.com/p/r35yvby49T/?modal=true">a sketch</a> and then built right in the code. Due to how infrequently my feeds updated, I pulled the plug on Daily since it was running on a paid server.

			<h2> NASA Design &amp; Games </h2>
			<p>
				I interned and freelanced with NASA's education outreach team. Their goal was to inform and inspire the public about the James Webb Space Telescope. I illustrated art for 2 games <a href="http://jwst.nasa.gov/scope.html">Scope it out!</a> and <a href="http://jwst.nasa.gov/build.html">Build It Yourself: Satellite!</a> I also made print designs which were <a href="http://sketch.bysusanlin.com/tagged/nasa">seen on the set of The Big Bang Theory.</a> It was an experience that set the tone for my entrance into the industry.
        <br><br>
        I had an opportunity later on to return to NASA and <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/goddard/2017/james-webb-space-telescope-art-exhibit-opens-to-public/">show an original watercolor</a> at the Goddard Visitor Center!

			<h2> Indie Games Creator </h2>
			<p>
				During college, I shipped <a href="http://www.gamecreation.org/search/node/susan%20lin">an indie game every semester.</a> The best of the bunch was Raincat &mdash; a 2D puzzle game where you keep the cat dry. <a href="http://bysusanlin.com/raincat">The site</a> I made to promote it has accrued over 16,000 views. It was a project that taught me how to share work online.
