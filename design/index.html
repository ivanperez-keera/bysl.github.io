			<h2> Design </h2>
			<p>
				I am a designer with 7 years of experience and a graduate MHCI degree from CMU. This is a selected history of work.

			<h2> Treehouse Product </h2>
			<p>
				I worked at <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse</a> as a Product Designer. My work included integrating <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree">Techdegree</a> into the consumer product (featured above), creating the <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/business">business product</a> onboarding experience, and <a href="/treehouse">designing an integrated learning motivation experience</a> which made recommendations based on student habits and goals. I sketched, created flows, mock-ups, InVision prototypes, and implemented the HTML/Sass for my designs.
				<br><br>
				I also contributed two posts about the process for the Engineering team blog: <a href="https://medium.com/treehouse-engineering/learning-how-to-write-again-21060d0f71e3">Learning how to write again</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/treehouse-engineering/the-surprising-parallels-between-oil-painting-and-product-design-90034828e0c7">The Surprising Parallels between Oil Painting and Product Design.</a>

			<h2> Treehouse Landing Pages </h2>
			<p>
				I worked on a variety of landing page designs for Treehouse. Designers were responsible for concepting, collaborating with stakeholders, designing, illustrating, and implementing the HTML/Sass for these pages. We deployed our own changes as well. Pages with A/B tests were templated in an internal tool which allowed the team to swap copy, illustrations, and photographs.
				<br><br>
				Featured above is the <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/about">About</a> page. I also worked on the <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/jobs">Careers</a> page, <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/">Homepage</a> variations, 2015 <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/back-to-school">Back to School</a> campaign, <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/subscribe/plans?trial=yes">Pricing</a> page variations, Success Story campaigns, and <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library">Library</a> previews.

			<h2> Treehouse Illustrations </h2>
			<p>
      	Treehouse's core brand featured a friendly illustration style. I contributed to and helped expand the illustration styleguide. I illustrated 100s of unique badges which were rewarded to students after completing a lesson. Each class had several lessons and the badges were designed to show progression. Additionally, I illustrated course assets used to make the learning experience more fun for Treehouse students. This included a <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2224666-Never-be-late-for-class">peaceful night time coding scene</a>, a <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2239242-Cameron-s-Coffee">coffee shop</a>, <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2358239-Donut">donuts</a>, <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2358228-Icecream">icecream</a>, and a <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2246344-Pomodoro-Timer">Pomodoro app.</a>

			<p>
				I am co-organizing a design anti-conference with <a href="http://nicoleblee.com">Nikki Lee.</a> We are collaborating on a schedule of activities for the weekend as well as the logistics and budgeting. I created the visual identity and illustrations, and implemented <a href="http://designplay.online">the responsive website.</a>

I lead design on the <a href="https://community.otrestaurant.com/t5/Conversations/Floor-Plan-Availability-View-and-Other-New-Guest-Center-Features/td-p/4036"> reservation timeline</a> as well as the Floor Plan Management beta website.

				I worked with <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blippy-make-your-own-gif-keyboard/id929359042?mt=8">Blippy</a> on their GIF collecting and sharing app. We iterated on the mobile interface and brand. I created and documented a visual design system. Blippy created one of the first <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/20/blippy-returns-with-a-brand-new-gif-keyboard-for-ios-8/">GIF keyboards for iOS8</a> and was well <a href="https://evtechwatch.blogspot.com/2014/11/gifblippy-ceodavid-king.html">loved by users in Japan</a>.

			<h2> Beyond Pricing </h2>
			<p>
				I worked with <a href="http://beyondpricing.com/">Beyond Pricing</a> to create a brand, website, and design system. The design components were created to work as a reusable system as new features are built. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/26/best-airbnb-price/">Beyond Pricing secured Series A funding</a> after my contributions.
				<br><br>
				A rave review of the brand: <br>
				"Airdna faces some stiff competition. [...] Beyond Pricing is one such product, and its slick beautiful design puts Airdnaâ€™s early 2000s look to shame."

			<h2> Trulia Design System </h2>
			<p>
				I was a founder and maintainer on the core design systems team. We created a living CSS design system to establish and maintain a cohesive design language. The components were reusable in the front-end codebase. We collaborated with <a href="http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2013/06/05/creating-living-style-guides-to-improve-performance/">Nicole Sullivan</a> and her team on the initial groundwork.

				<br><br>

				The design system was written in Sass using Object Oriented CSS (OOCSS) methodologies. The team built and open sourced <a href="http://trulia.github.io/hologram/">Hologram</a> a Ruby gem that generates a design system from your CSS comments.

				<br><br>

				<a href="/talks">I presented a talk</a> about the design system and how design processes evolved based on this work.

			<h2> Trulia </h2>
			<p>
				I lead design on Trulia consumer products. With the design system, it became easier to <a href="/images/work/trulia-css.gif">prototype quickly.</a> My contributions included leading <a href="/trulia">design on Search</a>, Home Detail Pages, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/06/trulia-suggest/">data-driven Recommend Homes</a>, Mobile Web, For Rent products, the <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1172093-Trulia-for-Android-Properties-details-page-update">Android app</a>, and <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1002475-trulia-the-house-oocss-built">Lego themed shirts.</a>
				<br><br>
				 After the team refreshed Search using our CSS library: <br>
				 "I like the direction that Trulia is taking its design. Deep-sixing that left rail of refiners is like a blast of fresh air across the page." <br>

			<h2> Daily RSS Feed </h2>
			<p>
				Daily was a fully responsive stream page of RSS feeds I frequented. It was set as my homepage when I started up my browser. The project was designed from <a href="http://instagram.com/p/r35yvby49T/?modal=true">a sketch</a> and then built right in the code. Due to how infrequently my feeds updated, I pulled the plug on Daily since it was running on a paid server.

			<h2> NASA Design &amp; Games </h2>
			<p>
				I interned and freelanced with NASA's education outreach team. Their goal was to inform and inspire the public about the James Webb Space Telescope. I illustrated art for 2 games <a href="http://jwst.nasa.gov/scope.html">Scope it out!</a> and <a href="http://jwst.nasa.gov/build.html">Build It Yourself: Satellite!</a> I also made print designs which were <a href="http://sketch.bysusanlin.com/tagged/nasa">seen on the set of The Big Bang Theory.</a> It was an experience that set the tone for my entrance into the industry.
        <br><br>
        I had an opportunity later on to return to NASA and <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/goddard/2017/james-webb-space-telescope-art-exhibit-opens-to-public/">show an original watercolor</a> at the Goddard Visitor Center!

			<h2> Indie Games Creator </h2>
			<p>
				During college, I shipped <a href="http://www.gamecreation.org/search/node/susan%20lin">an indie game every semester.</a> The best of the bunch was Raincat &mdash; a 2D puzzle game where you keep the cat dry. <a href="http://bysusanlin.com/raincat">The site</a> I made to promote it has accrued over 16,000 views. It was a project that taught me how to share work online.
