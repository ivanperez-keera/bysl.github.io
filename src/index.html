				Designer, Moonlight Painter

			<p>
				Hello World; I'm a designer who codes. I currentlywork at <a href="https://twitter.com/opentabledesign">OpenTable</a> on the Experience Design team. I am a <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/academics/hci-undergraduate/accelerated-masters">MHCI alum.</a>
			</p>

			<p>
				I draw incessantly. You may have seen my <a href="http://sketch.bysusanlin.com/tagged/sketchnotes">sketchnotes</a> out in the wild. I paint the <a href="http://cargocollective.com/susan/Ghibli-Stained-Glass">Ghibli Stained Glass</a> series and <a href="http://cargocollective.com/susan/The-Forest">Watercolor Forest.</a>
				Hayao Miyazaki inspires me like no other.
			</p>

			<p>
				I enjoy games and books. <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/pin/275423333437253958/">Ramona Flowers</a> is my spirit animal. My hair has been blue, purple, pink, red, green, and blue. &#10052;
