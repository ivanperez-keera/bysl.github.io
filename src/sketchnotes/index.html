			<h2> Sketchnotes </h2>

			<p>
					Hire me to sketchnote your event. I can effectively sketchnote topics in User Experience, Design Process, Front-end Engineering, and Diversity. <a href="http://sketch.bysusanlin.com/tagged/sketchnotes"> Check out the full archive of sketchnotes.</a>
			</p>

			<p>
				My terms: <br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						A ticket to your event.
					</li>
					<li>
						Travel and hotel covered, if applicable.
					</li>
					<li>
						Market freelance rate paid by the hour. Expect to cover hours preparing the set-up, time spent drawing talks, and post-processing.
					</li>
					<li>
						If your event is not-for-profit and a cause I believe in, we can work something out.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				The works: <br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						You may promote your event with an official sketchnoter.
					</li>
					<li>
						I draw in realtime, so you can live-tweet them during the conference.
					</li>
					<li>
						You will receive high-resolution sketchnotes images to share for present and future events.
					</li>
					<li>
						I will cross-promote from my personal accounts before, during, and after the event.
					</li>
					<li>
						(Optional) Gift sketchnotes to your speakers! Provide the nice paper. I can consult on frames and gift presentation if you'd like.
					</li>
				</ul>
